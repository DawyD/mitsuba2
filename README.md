The Mitsuba 2 'next' branch originally available at this location provided a
just-in-time compiler that can generate OptiX/LLVM megakernel implementations
of ordinary and differentiable rendering algorithms. We originally intended to
officially release this system as part of a SIGGRAPH'21 paper
(https://rgl.epfl.ch/publications/Vicini2021PathReplay).

As part of peer review process, we were, however, requested to remove all
discussion of the system and publish it separately. Due to the awkward and
uncertain status of this project, we decided to take it offline for the time
being.
